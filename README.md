##Gifts Finder

Giftsfinder is a survey that consists of 112 rating scale questions designed to discover likely areas of giftedness in serving.
This main PHP page both presents the questions off of the GET request and processes the submit of the POST.  The PHP code at
the top of this page hanldes the POST by tablulating and displaying the results and emailing a copy.  This does use 
bootstrap.js to be responsive to smartphone, tablet and desktop screen sizes.
